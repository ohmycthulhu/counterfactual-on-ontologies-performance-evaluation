## Performance Evaluation for Counterfactual Generation on Ontologies

This repository contains tools for measuring performance of the algorithm aimed at generating counterfactual explanations on OWL ontologies.

The metrics specification can be found at [[Metrics.md]] and technical details and interfaces in [[Specification.md]].

## Profiling

For using profiling in more detailed way, you may use [scalene](https://pypi.org/project/scalene/) by specifying `-m scalene` for interpreter:
```commandline
venv/bin/python -m scalene src/main.py
```
